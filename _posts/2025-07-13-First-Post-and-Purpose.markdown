Welcome Reader,

In the first post of my blogging journey, I wanted to give a brief introduction about myself and the purpose of starting this journey. 

Hi, I am Abhinav Singh, hailing from India. I have more than 8 years of experience in Automation Testing. In all  my years, I never ventured into blogging and would like to start now. I plan to blog automation testing concepts / frameworks and new things that I learn going forward. 

I was introduced to Testing when I joined Accenture as a fresher straight after my bachelor's degree. I quickly moved onto Automation Testing from Manual testing and have been enjoying it since. In Accenture I was working with Java and Selenium to perform Web testing. I left Accenture after 6 years to study masters degree in Adelaide, Australia. Once finished, I joined Sintelix as a Test Automation Specialist and worked with Java and Playwright. I also learned a lot of areas of testing here like API testing using Postman/RestAssured as well as Performance Testing with inhouse tools. Throughout my journey I have also used Python to build useful tools for simple tasks like to generate Test Data. In Sintelix, I was a solo tester and worked on everything from Scratch including defining Test Processes and Automation Frameworks.

Currently, I am searching for a job and in the meantime hope to share some of existing knowledge via this blog as well as blog about new things that I learn in the future. 

Thank you for reading my first post.
