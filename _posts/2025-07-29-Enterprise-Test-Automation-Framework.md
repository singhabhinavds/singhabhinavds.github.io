Welcome Reader,

Today I wanted to write about a repository I was working on which is called 'Playwright_TS'. It is a implementation of a Test Automation Framework that can be used in an Enterprise. It is implemented using Playwright and Typescript.
Since, I had no prior knowledge of typescript, I had to learn the syntax as well.

Any Test Automation Framework that needs to be used in an enterprise environment needs to have scalability and efficiency and hence our automation framework would have the following salient features:

1. Parallel Testing
2. Reporting/Logging
3. CI/CD Integration
4. Resuable Utilities
5. Environment Management
6. Data Parameterization
7. Credentials Encryption
8. Version Control
9. Cross Browser testing
10. Code Quality
11. API Testing

Playwright supports most of these functionalities out of the box like parallel testing, reporting, cross browser tesitng. So, I will not have to implement them separately. We will be using Page Object model as a design pattern in the framework. 

Head over to the repository if you want to check it out : [Playwright_TS Repository](https://github.com/singhabhinavds/Playwright_TS)

If there are any questions or any features you want to see in the repository, please dont hesitate to send me a message.
